= rsh

Author:: Pavel Argentov (argentoff at gmail dot com)

Here's a simple tiny wrapper which alows me to use rsh shell command in PORO
(Plain Old Ruby Object) style. For all details see Rsh class rdoc.

This gem was developed and tested on FreeBSD 8.1. If you find any
incompatibilities and/or are ready to help me fix the problem feel free to
write me on the public email listed above.
