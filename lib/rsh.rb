# = UNIX rsh(1) wrapper class
# 
# Creates and operates an 'rsh' command call instance. Parameters to rsh may
# be specified through either constructor or attribute accessors. Result of
# rsh execution (_String_) is either returned in functional style (<tt>##execute</tt> method call)
# or in special attribute, _result_.
#
# == Synopsis
#
#   require 'rsh'
#
#   rsh = Rsh.new(:host => "c7206", :ruser => "bill",
#                 :command => "show clock")
#
#   rsh.execute do |line| puts line end

  # The Constructor. Checks the presence of rsh in the system (running,
  # naturally, 'which rsh') and prepares the command to be run with <tt>##execute</tt>. 
  # rsh CLI arguments are either having default values, being collected from constructor 
  # call or specified via accessors.
