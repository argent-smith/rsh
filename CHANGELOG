 * execute -> execute!

    In Rsh class: changed and renamed "execute" method though leaving it
    compatible with the previous version. Now execute! may be called with a remote
    command String as a parameter: it will be recorded in @command instance
    variable and then executed as usual.

 * Farewell, Rubyforge!

    Removed rubyforge_project from specification: it points to a wrong place (a
    completely different project with the same name). This project at the moment
    is hosted solely on GitHub.com; gem is published on rubygems.org.
