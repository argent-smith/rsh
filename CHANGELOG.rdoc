[0cb9667 | Sun Oct 31 07:26:45 UTC 2010] Pavel Argentov <argentoff@gmail.com>

 * First byte experiment

    Try to throw away first byte of server's output (it seems to be kinda 
    signalling char [ref?]); also made the lookup of rsh binary mandatory 
    again since :ruby_impl can change during the Rsh instance's lifetime.

 * execute -> execute!

    In Rsh class: changed and renamed "execute" method though leaving it
    compatible with the previous version. Now execute! may be called with a remote
    command String as a parameter: it will be recorded in @command instance
    variable and then executed as usual.

[b937438 | Wed Oct 27 08:43:12 UTC 2010] Pavel Argentov <argentoff@gmail.com>

 * Farewell, Rubyforge!

    Removed rubyforge_project from specification: it points to a wrong place (a
    completely different project with the same name). This project at the moment
    is hosted solely on GitHub.com; gem is published on rubygems.org.
